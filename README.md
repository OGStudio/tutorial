This document is part of [OGStudio education program][education].

The tutorials describe how to create (and share) simple game with `ogs`
in a matter of few hours.

# Tools

Our main tool is `ogse`
([http://ogstudio.github.io/ogse](https://ogstudio.github.io/ogse)),
a minimalistic on-line editor:

![screen-editor]

On the left side:

* button to execute the code
* code editor

On the right side:

* render window to depict code execution result
* debug console to output valuable information

`ogse` is powered by `ogs`, a tool to create cross-platform 3D games.
`ogs` uses `Lua` language for scripting.

**Note**: your [web browser should have `WebGL` support][webgl] to be able to
run code samples.
