# Editor

`ogs` itself is a cross-platform tool, a library. However, to be able to
quickly check ideas or test code snippers, we provide an on-line editor
called `ogse`:

[https://ogstudio.github.io/ogse](https://ogstudio.github.io/ogse)

Open the link in your browser. You should see the following:

# Distribute with GitHub Pages

In our case, the simplest game is just an empty render window.

Let's distribute the game with [GitHub Pages][github-pages].

| â„– | Action | Notes | Screenshot |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1. | Go to `Settings` | | ![screen-settings] |
| 2. | Select `master branch` as the source | Under `GitHub Pages` section | ![screen-source] |
| 3. | Hit `Save` | | ![screen-save] |
| 4. | Verify activation | | ![screen-activation] |
| 5. | Wait for publishing | | ![screen-published] |

# Run the game

**Note**: your web browser **must** have [`WebGL` enabled and working][webgl].

![screen-index]

Click on the link `GitHub Pages` gave you. You should see an empty render window.

# Access debug console

![screen-debug]

Append `/debug.html` to the end of URL and hit `Enter` to access the same game with
debug console enabled.

Debug console is an important tool to debug your `ogstudio` games.
